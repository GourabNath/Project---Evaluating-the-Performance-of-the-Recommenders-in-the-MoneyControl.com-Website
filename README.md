# Project---Evaluating-the-Performance-of-the-Recommenders-in-the-MoneyControl.com-Website
In www.moneycontrol.com, various recommenders post recommendations on the buy, sell and hold decisions of various stocks. This project was aimed to evaluate the performance of the recommenders over the time and under various market conditions. The work involves scrapping few hundred pages of information from the moneycontrol website and then scrap the stock price of each stocks from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India starting from the date of recommendation up to a year later.  Cleaning and arranging the scrapped data had consumed a major portion of the project. Finally, a meaningful visual dashboard is created to summarize important information and rank various recommenders.
